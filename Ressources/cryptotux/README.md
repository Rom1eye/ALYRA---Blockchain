# Cryptotux

Cryptotux is a Linux image preconfigured with tools for crypto development and education.

Cryptotux is currently supplied as .ova images that can be directly imported into Virtualbox (6.X+). 
It is particularly suited for workshops. Username is *bobby*, password is *bricodeur*.

## How to use it? The easy way
* Install [virtualbox](https://virtualbox.org)
* Download the desktop or server version on [cryptotux.org](https://cryptotux.org)
* Click on the file or in "import appliance" in virtualbox
* Launch from virtualbox
* For the server version, it is best to connect via ssh `ssh bobby@192.168.33.10`
* For the desktop version interact visually ! 

For ease you can also sync a local folder, let's call it remote, and the internal folder of the machine with `sshfs bobby@cryptotux-server:/home/bobby remote`

Optionnaly, add cryptotux as known hosts (on Unix systems `echo '192.168.33.10 cryptotux' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`). You will then be able to connect with `ssh bobby@cryptotux`

## To build from scratch

* Install vagrant and virtualbox. On a debian or ubuntu system `sudo apt install vagrant virtualbox`
* To build and run the server version `vagrant up`
* To connect to the server : `vagrant ssh`

And voilÃ  !

* To build and run the desktop version `vagrant up cryptotux-desktop`

## Contribution
We aim to provide a useful tool and meaningful project as a collaborative effort. The first objective is to offer a standard distribution for education and development. Suggestions, remarks, partnerships and pull requests are welcome.
